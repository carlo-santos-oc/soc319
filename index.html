                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The rise of the internet as a global communication system represented a new economical frontier. It
                    allowed countries to freely exchange information across the world in the blink of an eye. China
                    recognized how transformative this technology could be and how it could further aid its economic
                    rehabilitation. However, the internet also posed a threat to its authoritarian control of its
                    citizens. The internet is a vast landscape that provides social platforms for people to exchange
                    ideas freely. The Chinese government needed a way to gain the economic benefits of using the
                    internet while preventing its citizens from adopting foreign ideologies. In this paper I will
                    explore how China built a wall around its internet, what its goals are for controlling the flow of
                    information and what affects this wall has had on its citizens.

                </p>
                <h2>Theories</h2>
                <p>

                    According to Gary King, Jennifer Pan and Margarete E Roberts, there are two theories why the Chinese
                    government wants to censor the internet. The first theory is called state critique theory. This
                    theorizes that the Chinese government wants to limit the sharing of any ideologies that faults
                    Chinese leaders, the government and policies. The second theory is called collective action
                    potential. This is the theory that the Chinese government wants to censor any potential collective
                    action that is inspired by someone other than the Chinese government. This censorship effectively
                    limits the ability of citizens to organize protests. [King, Pan, Roberts]

                    <h2>The Technology</h2>
                    <p>

                        In information technology, a firewall is known to be a security program that blocks untrusted
                        internet networks from accessing your personal network and computer. It is a tool designed to
                        provide people with a barrier of protection from any nefarious entities in the vast internet
                        space. The Great Firewall of China is a foreign term given to the Chinese governments
                        technological and policy rules used to filter internet content coming into the country from
                        outside sources. This censorship effort by the government is known in China as the “Golden
                        Shield Project.” The scope of this project includes security management information system,
                        criminal information system, exit and entry administration information system, supervisor
                        information system and traffic management information system. [Chandel, Jingji, Yunnan, Jingyao,
                        Zhipeng] The Golden Shield Project was launched by the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission of
                        the People’s Republic of China. By 1994 the internet was becoming the most popular and widely
                        used platform for communication. The Chinese government knew they needed to open its borders to
                        the internet in order to maintain its economic resurgence. President Jiang Zemin believed the
                        development of the internet represented the third wave of industrialization. He believed China
                        missed out on the previous wave and did not want to again fall behind western powers. [Lokman]
                        However, they did not want western ideas and influences to affect its citizens. The Golden
                        Shield Project was launched in 1996 and started deploying in 2004. The development went through
                        several stages before deployment.

                    </p>
                    <h3><em>Stages</em></h3>
                    <p>

                        The first stage on the Golden Shield project was blocking domain names and IP addresses. A
                        domain
                        name is given to an IP address of a server hosting web content. For instance, Googles IP address
                        is
                        8.8.8.8. Instead of making people remember IP addresses for every website, a domain name server
                        (DNS) assigns the name www.google.com to the IP address of Googles server. These domain names
                        and IP
                        addresses are put on a list that denies Chinese citizen’s access. The government worked with
                        local
                        police to install surveillance cameras at internet cafes to identify anyone who successfully
                        accessed websites that are on the banned list. [Chandel, Jingji, Yunnan, Jingyao, Zhipeng]


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keyword censorship was implemented in the second stage. Keyword filtering allowed the government
                        to
                        scan website content for certain phrases that are deemed to be sensitive. Any phrases
                        criticizing
                        the government, such as “Illegal detention,” would be censored. [Chandel, Jingji, Yunnan,
                        Jingyao,
                        Zhipeng]

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stage three was the development of VPN detection. Golden Shield developers were able to identify
                        certain ports used by VPN services. When these ports are accessed, the connection is halted.
                        This
                        hindered many of China’s VPN companies but did not shut them down completely. [Chandel, Jingji,
                        Yunnan, Jingyao, Zhipeng]

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth stage was the establishment of laws preventing anonymity and unauthorized VPN use. In
                        order to surveil users, the Chinese government required internet service providers to maintain
                        records of its users and how much time they spent online. VPNs were required by some
                        institutions
                        for commerce and scientific purposes. For this reason, the government limited VPN use to only
                        authorized providers. Anyone caught illegally providing VPN services faced fines and jail time.

                <h2>Chinese Citizen sentiment</h2>
                <p>

                    A survey conducted in 2005 found that over 80% of citizens approved of internet censorship. Some
                    Chinese citizens even view Western perceptions of their internet censorship experience as a hoax.
                    [Lokman] This acceptance of censorship and its effects can be seen today. After the COVID-19
                    outbreak that was first reported in Wuhan China, author Fang Fang released a book which accounted
                    the event of the discovery of the COVID-19 outbreak and its aftermath. The book was critical of the
                    attempted government cover-up of what happened but did not directly criticize the government itself.
                    Chinese social media users, mostly young people, condemned the book and author for not acknowledging
                    the efforts of the Chinese government to contain the outbreak. This young generation of internet
                    citizens (Netizens) saw Fang Fang’s book as a perpetuation of Western smear campaigns to blame China
                    for the outbreak. These Netizens have also taken aim at media that is critical of Chinese society.
                    Big Shot’s Funeral is a classic Chinese comedy that is a satirical take on capitalists in China, but
                    Netizens now believe this movie to be “a smear on national entrepreneurs.” Even the sale of TikTok’s
                    US operations has been perceived as the CEO lap dogging to the US. [Wang] The increased
                    nationalistic view of young people represents a change most likely welcome by the Chinese
                    government. Before the Great Firewall, the internet was a much freer place for young people to
                    express ideas and challenge authority. They were able to create content that put pressure on
                    government officials to right any perceived wrongs. The slogan for this kind of content was
                    “changing China through collective spectating.” Once the Great Firewall went up and strict
                    censorship of government criticism was scrubbed away, Netizens were left with an online experience
                    that would never show the Chinese government as doing any wrong. There are young people that have
                    lived with a censored internet experience all their lives. They never got to experience an internet
                    that encouraged free thinking.

                </p>
                <h2>Attack on protests</h2>
                <p>

                    The Great Firewall is not just a tool for censorship and surveillance. The Chinese government has
                    used its control over the internet to quell any protests against itself. In 2011 a group of Netizens
                    anonymously organized a Jasmine Revolution. A Jasmine Revolution is a pro-democracy movement aimed
                    at challenging the one-party rule of the Chinese government. They looked to mimic the Arab Spring
                    uprising that occurred in the middle east. This protest started online and received global
                    attention. It led to the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and inspired other middle
                    eastern countries to stage their own uprisings. [Aljazeera] China viewed the Jasmine Revolution as a
                    direct threat to its communist regime and responded by detaining over 25 people, making over 30
                    disappear and sending over 200 more to soft detentions. Some sentences were as much as 10 years.
                    [NCHRD] A more recent example of quelling protests made headlines a few weeks before this writing.
                    Protests have broken out in China due to growing frustration among citizens over the Chinese
                    governments zero-tolerance COVID-19 lockdowns. It is well past the time when most of the world has
                    ended lockdowns and opened their borders back up for travelers, but the Chinese government has
                    chosen to continue strict lockdown polices if any outbreaks of COVID-19 are detected. These
                    protesters know they are not able to use Chinese platforms to communicate and assemble with other
                    protesters, so they have turned to using VPNs to access outside platform like Twitter and Telegram.
                    What citizens are finding when they try and search Twitter for information on cities that have
                    staged protests is a flood of spam tweets about pornography, escort services and gambling. A large
                    number of these spamming Twitter accounts have not been active until recently, which leads to the
                    belief that it is an organized army of bot accounts attempting to bury any mention of the protests
                    going on. [Liao, Shu] This organization of bot accounts is being attributed to the Chinese
                    government reaching beyond its own social media applications to control the information it wants its
                    citizens to see.

                    <h2>Propaganda and the Fifty-Cent Party</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Chinese government uses the Great Firewall to control the flow of information on the
                        internet, but it has evolved its tactics beyond deploying filtering technologies. China saw the
                        need to not only filter unwanted western ideologies, but to also have Netizens advocate for the
                        regime. They employed citizens to post progovernment propaganda in exchange for money. This
                        group of progovernment Netizens were dubbed the “Fifty-Cent Party” by Netizens to make light of
                        the fact that these posters get paid to side with government ideology. [Chander] The effort by
                        the government to employ people to speak glowingly of the regime and to steer public opinion was
                        quickly recognized and decried by regular Netizens, but over the years a new constituent of
                        Netizens emerged that adopted more nationalistic views and came to aid the governments efforts.
                        This new constituent of Netizens dubbed themselves the “Voluntary Fifty-cent Army.” [Han] This
                        new constituency denounced anyone who spoke critically of the Chinese government and labeled
                        them as various names including “U.S.-cent party.” This deliberate mentioning of the United
                        States shows their rejection of western influences.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        VPNs
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2015, China blocked most of the widely used VPNs people used to access content outside of the
                        Great Firewall. This was a surprise move by the government as it is widely known that VPNs are
                        required to facilitate global economic activity such as banking, commerce and scientific
                        endeavors. [Economy] The Chinese government has so far allowed the use of remaining VPNs despite
                        its policies against foreign content. However, it has targeted individuals online with its army
                        of internet moderators for spreading “rumors” if they choose to post strong opinions that go
                        against the government. Chinese Netizens risk being hit with defamation lawsuits if they post
                        anything the government deems is “false news.” A lot of Netizens have resorted to talking in
                        code when they want to voice their opinion. They do this by using words that are similar to what
                        the Great Firewall would most likely censor. Charlie Smith, a founder of FreeWeibo.com,
                        theorized that this blocking of VPNs was a natural move towards China’s goal of
                        “cyber-sovereignty.” This is the belief that the government has the right to regulate and censor
                        any information that comes into their borders. [Yuen]

                <h2>US similarity</h2>
                <p>
                    Researching this topic made me think about a phenomenon that US citizens experience that has
                    similar effects to that of the Great Firewall. In the US, we have a freer internet experience
                    than China. Our first amendment right gives us the right to freely speak our minds. But there is
                    a comparable phenomenon to China’s Great Firewall that some may experience in the states through
                    media consolidation. This is when corporate entities own most, or all, of the news stations in a
                    geographical area. [Andrews] Corporate entities have political leanings, and those leanings are
                    expressed through the media outlets they own. If you happen to live in an area of the US that
                    only has news outlets owned by one corporation, you will have little exposure to any news
                    critical of the political party in which the corporation aligns its interests. The people in
                    these regions adopt the political ideologies served to them everyday as they do not have access
                    to alternative voices to give them the news. This situation only affects people who still
                    consume their information through traditional means such as tv and newspapers. Some of these
                    pockets in the US do not have great internet access which may further narrow their ability to
                    seek alternative media voices. But the difference between the situation in the US compared to
                    China is that China has spread their propaganda campaign to encompass the internet entirely. US
                    citizens can find refuge from propaganda if they are able to find an internet source to seek out
                    different voices, but Chinese citizens are locked into their bubble of information wherever they
                    go.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>

                    Gary King, Jennifer Pan and Margarete E Roberts created two theories to explain why China created
                    the Great Firewall. From my research I found both theories have compelling evidence to back them up.
                    The Great Firewall of China is not just a technological barrier deployed by the government to shield
                    its citizens from the vast content of the world wide web. It is a sophisticated collection of
                    policies and surveillance designed to control and alter the flow of information within China to
                    discourage the spread of ideologies and gathering of people that would negatively impact the
                    government itself. The Chinese government designed the Great Firewall because they need the
                    economical growth associated with utilizing the internet but did not want to risk exposing Chinese
                    citizens to platforms that introduced then the Western ideologies or could encourage any negative
                    political demonstrations. The Great Firewall has evolved beyond passive technology for blocking and
                    censoring content. It is now a major government department that employs millions of workers. Early
                    Chinese Netizens still remember a time before the Great Firewall where they were free to have
                    political discourse and to organize demonstrations. Those that still want to express their thoughts
                    online must do so in coded language that would slip past the censorship bots and workers watching
                    their every interaction online. Netizens are also still able to access the internet outside of the
                    Great Firewall, but the shutdown of the most widely used VPNs has made that a lot harder. Tech savvy
                    citizens will be able to figure this out, but it is less likely for novice tech users and less
                    educated citizens to bother trying. Chinese citizens have lived with this much restricted internet
                    access since 2004. In the time since, a new generation of Netizens have emerged that have only ever
                    known the internet under the Great Firewall. This has led to the rise of more nationalistic
                    ideologies spreading online. The affects of China’s Great Firewall policies are working to advance
                    government leaderships ideologies and influence. So much so that other authoritarian regimes are
                    following suit. The ongoing protests in Iran led to the government shutting down social media
                    applications like Instagram and Twitter in order to hinder protester’s ability to assemble. [Sriram]
                    The grip of the Chinese government on its citizens access to information and discourse sounds
                    insurmountable, but if citizens are still willing to find loopholes in the system and are aware of
                    the heavy censorship they experience compared to most of the world then there is hope that they can
                    one day demand some of the freedoms we experience when it comes to the use of the internet.
